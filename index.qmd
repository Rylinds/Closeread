Hello World! Please read my Closeread story below.

:::{.cr-section}
This is a Closeread section

I want my sticky to appear here ➡️ @cr-identifier

:::{#cr-identifier}
This block of text is a sticky within the Closeread section!
:::

Below is another block of text we'll be working with:
@cr-highlighted <!-- @cr-highlighted refers to a block of text defined below with the identifier 'cr-highlighted'. -->

First, let's scale this block of text by two:
[@cr-highlighted]{scale-by="2"}

Next, we’ll highlight lines 2 and 3 while keeping the same scale:
[@cr-highlighted]{scale-by="2" highlight="2-3"}

Now, let’s bring in an image:
@cr-image

It’s a bit large at first—taking up the full screen. Let’s scale it down:
[@cr-image]{scale-by="0.5"}

Finally, we’ll pan to the portion highlighted in red:
[@cr-image2]{pan-to="-75%,75%" scale-by="1.5"}

When you `pan` and `scale` at the same time, you end up `zooming`!
